# janus

#### God of beginnings and passages
Janus looks after passages, causes actions to start and presides over all beginnings.

#### God of change
Janus frequently symbolized change and transitions such as the progress of past to future, from one condition to another, from one vision to another, and young people's growth to adulthood. He represented time, because he could see into the past with one face and into the future with the other.
